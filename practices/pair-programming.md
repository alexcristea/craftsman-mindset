# Pair Programming (PP)

Pair Programming is the team practice of two people working together to write a single stream of code. The two work together on a line-by-line, character-by-character basis. They are co-authors of the code being produced.

## Motivation

The main reason why we pair is teamwork. Like within football, whenever a team member goes down, the rest of the team knows how to cover that vacancy.

However, for that to happen each team member must know someone else’s job. We pair with each other so that we can cover for each other.

The secondary reason why we pair are the side effects of the teamwork: enhance our productivity, reduce the defect rate and improve the system design. You don’t pair to get help, that’s a side effect.

## Mechanics

### Each story has an owner

Pairs do not own stories; programmers do.

A story will have a single owner but many different pairing sessions and pairing partners. Ideally, in an iteration, most team members will work on most stories.

### Pairing is voluntary

There is no schedule created by managers or leaders. You decide when pairing is appropriate or when is not.

The only rule is that, when you’re asked, you must say yes.

Also, you don’t have to pair 100% of the time. 50% of the time is good enough. 20% may be too little to share enough knowledge.

### Pairing sessions are short

One, up to two hours. Two, up to four pomodoro.

### Anybody can pair with anybody

Regardless of the specialty of job function. The goal is knowledge sharing, the more widely you pair the better.

GUI can pair with database, QA can pair with middleware. Juniors can pair with juniors while watched by seniors. Juniors can pair with seniors. While seniors will be slowed down for an hour, the juniors will be sped up for life. Seniors can pair with seniors, but make sure there are no weapons in the room.

### Take care of your hygiene

I guess there is no need for comments.

### On-site vs. remote pairs

On-site teams can pair at a single workstation, sharing the screen, keyboard, and mouse between them or at a single workstation with dual controls -- two screens, keyboards, and mice.

Remote teams can pair through screen and keyboard sharing software. Although it’s harder than on-site and probably more frustrating, there are some cool tools, like [Tuple](https://tuple.app), to help. You can make it work, but it’s better if you don’t have to.

### Productivity

There is a misconception that pairing splits the team productivity in half. It’s not the case. First and foremost, you don’t have to pair 100% of the time. Mature agile teams pair for around half the time.

Secondly, the bottleneck is not in the fingers, but rather in the head. There is an old saying: "Two heads are better than one".
Studies show that pairing 100% of the time result in a 15% loss of instantaneous productivity (over an hour or a day — not over a month).

However, these teams produce fewer bugs and fewer lines of code in that time. Features with fewer lines of code mean features with a better design.
